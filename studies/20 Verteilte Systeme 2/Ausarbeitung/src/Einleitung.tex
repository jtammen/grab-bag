\section{Definition von Clay Shirky}
\begin{quote}
"`P2P is a class of applications that takes advantage of resources – storage,
cycles, content, human presence – available at the edge of the Internet.
Because accessing these decentralized resources means operating in an
environment of unstable connectivity and unpredictable IP addresses, P2P
nodes must operate outside the DNS system and have significant or total
autonomy from central servers."'
